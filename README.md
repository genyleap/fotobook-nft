# FotobookNFT
**FotobookNFT** is a decentralized platform where artists, photographers, and everyday creators can mint, showcase, and monetize unique NFTs from their photos, artworks, and videos. Conceived by **Erik Smit**, this platform is built on the Base blockchain to empower creators with a simple, creator-friendly experience. Mint your NFTs, curate beautiful galleries, auction or sell your work, and connect with a vibrant communityâ€”all while retaining full ownership of your creations.

Inspired by the nostalgia of physical photo books, FotobookNFT is your digital space to create, preserve, and share your art.
